** Summary
This presentation outlined the decision to pursue a degree in Supply-Chain Management as a means to address ethical and transparency failures in global commerce.
The Problem: I analyzed the systemic issues in global supply chains, such as the lack of transparency that enabled tragedies like the Rana Plaza collapse.
The Proposed Solution: I argued that blockchain technology could serve as the foundational infrastructure for a new, transparent supply chain. By using an immutable and distributed ledger, companies could provide verifiable proof of provenance, ensure ethical labor practices, and create true end-to-end visibility for both consumers and investors.
