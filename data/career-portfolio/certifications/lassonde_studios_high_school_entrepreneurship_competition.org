** Summary
As part of an entrepreneurship competition, I developed a comprehensive business plan for "Valle," a B Corp certified, Fair Trade fashion brand. The plan was built on a detailed analysis of the "fast fashion" industry and proposed a multi-faceted solution:
A Modular Product System: A line of apparel featuring detachable, layered extensions, allowing for user customization and solving the comfort/style trade-off of traditional layering.
A Strategic Global Mission: A business model centered on partnering with manufacturers in developing nations (e.g., Bangladesh) to strategically invest in their industrial growth. The plan detailed adherence to the Bangladesh Accord on Fire and Building Safety to ensure ethical production.
A Detailed Go-to-Market Strategy: The plan outlined a digital-first marketing strategy using social media, lookbooks, and targeted ads to build brand awareness. It also focused on creating a luxury "brand experience" through high-quality packaging and a "Valle Mission booklet" to engage customers with the brand's story.

** Relevance

This project is the earliest documented evidence of my core operating principles. It demonstrates a foundational ability to conduct market research, develop a comprehensive go-to-market strategy, and design a solution to a complex systems problem. The plan's focus on brand experience, customer engagement, and ethical-but-strategic global operations is a direct precursor to the systems-oriented thinking required in a Revenue or Sales Operations role.
