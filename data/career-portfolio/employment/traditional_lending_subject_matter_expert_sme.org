:POSITION: Traditional Lending, Subject-Matter-Expert (SME)
:START_DATE: 2021-11-01

:SUMMARY: Hired into this newly created role to solve a critical business problem: high-value borrowers were being lost to high-interest products. My mission was to design and implement a complete sales enablement system from the ground up to equip a 15-person sales team to sell more complex traditional loans. This involved architecting everything from lead identification processes and automation workflows to a data-driven coaching program and performance scorecards, ultimately acting as the de facto sales operations function for the product line.
