:COMPANY: Sprint
:POSITION: Sr. Sales Representative
:START_DATE: 2019-05-01

:SUMMARY: As a Sr. Sales Representative and keyholder, my responsibilities expanded to include manager-on-duty tasks, such as daily store operations, cash handling, and inventory control. I took the initiative to architect and implement coaching and sales process systems to drive team performance. A key strategic achievement was leveraging our store's unique status as a district repair hub to design a novel "account audit" process, transforming non-revenue service visits into the district's top-performing B2B sales pipeline.
