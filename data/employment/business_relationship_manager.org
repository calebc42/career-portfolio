* Business Relationship Manager
:PROPERTIES:
:COMPANY: TCS Equipment Finance
:POSITION: Business Relationship Manager
:START_DATE: 2023-02-01
:END_DATE: 2023-05-31
:SUMMARY: Recruited into this role, I was formally trained on the Sandler consultative selling methodology and tasked with full-cycle, middle-market prospecting. Using tools like D&B Hoovers and ZoomInfo, I executed a high-volume cold calling strategy to build a pipeline of opportunities with C-level executives. While successful in building a pipeline, I quickly identified a fundamental misalignment between the company's high-volume GTM strategy and its highly selective credit policy, which led to a strategic pivot.
