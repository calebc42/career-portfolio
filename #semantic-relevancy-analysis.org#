#+end_example

This is a fantastic result. You've successfully narrowed the focus, and now the scores are starting to differentiate, even if they're still low. The fact that "Performance Management System Design" is now in the top 3 is a huge win—it's a sign we're on the right track.

However, you're right to be critical. A score of 0.44 is still weak, and the top results are a strange mix. "Corporate Training" and "Personal Goal Setting" are likely appearing because they have generic business language that weakly matches the generic language in the job description.

This is the classic next step in debugging a semantic system. We've improved the "signal" by focusing the data, but now we need to make the signal itself cleaner.

The problem lies in what we're asking the model to compare.

Your Accomplishment Vector: Right now, you're creating one vector for the entire S.T.A.R. story. That vector represents the average meaning of the situation, the task, the action, and the result combined.

Your Job Description Vector: You're creating one vector for a large paragraph of job duties. That vector represents the average meaning of all those duties combined.

The model finds a weak match because the "average" of your accomplishment is only slightly similar to the "average" of the job description. The key, powerful phrases are being diluted.

The Next Evolution: From Paragraphs to Key Points
Let's refine our approach. The most impactful part of your accomplishment is what you did and what the result was. The Situation and Task are just context.

Question: What if we only created the vector from the "Action" and "Result" text?

This would create a much more potent, focused "fingerprint" of your achievement.

script is working flawlessly from a technical perspective. The issue isn't in the code; it's in the subtlety of the data.

Look at the concepts where it found "No strong matches":

Compensation & Financial Planning

Forecasting & Data Analysis

BI & Salesforce Reporting

Now, look at your strongest accomplishment for "BI & Salesforce Reporting," which is likely the "Performance Management System Design" from your GTM Sales Manager role. The text of that accomplishment is: "Built the team's entire performance management system in Google Sheets, using the Salesforce Connector to pull in data... Created dashboards to track KPIs..."

To a human, this is a perfect match. But to the AI model, the language is just different enough to miss the connection. The job description says "SFDC, Tableau, BI," while your accomplishment says "Google Sheets, Salesforce Connector, dashboards." The model is getting hung up on the specific tool names instead of recognizing the underlying concept of building a BI dashboard.

We have successfully refined the script to the point where it's a perfect tool,
but we're feeding it slightly the wrong "fuel."
